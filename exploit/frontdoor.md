# Solution

## Description of the problem

This task may seem like an easy, silly, and unrealistic toy sample, but many real-world apps screwed up the same way.

## Solution

I changed the debug to true, the other remain the same, and upload it to system to get the flag.

```
    if (debug) {
        urlParameters = "username=testuser&password=passtestuser123";
    } else {
        urlParameters = "username=" + username + "&password=" + password;
    }
```
