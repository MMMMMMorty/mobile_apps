## Description of the problem

Component hijacking is a common vulnerability for Android apps. But our dear developer attended MOBISEC class and knows about it: She used cryptography to prevent that attackers can "jump start" arbitrary activities. [Narrator: our dear developer did not pass the final MOBISEC exam.]

## Solution

Here the message to verify, it doesn't verify the identity of the receiver and sender, so I can change the message ```Intent i = Main.buildIntent("A", "B");``` in ```MainActivity``` to ```Intent i = Main.buildIntent("B", "C", "Main-to-A/A-to-B");```. Through this, I can access to C class. To make sure everything is correct, I build up my own ```C``` class first. After the authentication in ```C``` is correct and I can receive the message from it. I changed to call the ```com.mobisec.nojumpstarts.C``` and get the flag.
